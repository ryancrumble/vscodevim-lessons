# VSCode Vim Lessons

## Overview

This repository contains a series of interactive lessons designed to help users learn and master Vim within VSCode.

The structure, style, and exercises are heavily inspired by the excellent [Boost Your Coding Fu With VSCode and Vim](https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/boost-your-coding-fu-with-vscode-and-vim/) series found on the **Barbarian Meets Coding** website.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide practical, hands-on exercises covering various aspects of Vim usage in VSCode, from basic movements and editing to more advanced topics like macros, splits, and integrations.

Initially, I started learning Vim using the lessons provided by the VSCode extension ["vintharas.learn-vim"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vintharas.learn-vim). However, I found that the lessons only went up to a certain point. Wanting to continue learning and practicing, I decided to have additional exercises generated. These exercises were created with the assistance of AI and are based on the structure and topics from the original series.
